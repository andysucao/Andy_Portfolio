      <description>1. Overview In this project, we will build a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) based model for Natural Language Inference. The performance of the model will be evaluated on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus. To further understand how it works, we will visualize attention mechanism and compare output embedding of BERT using Euclidean distance and Cosine similarity.&#xA;The Python Notebook containing the complete model development process and the data used in this project can be found at Google Drive.</description>

      <description>1. Overview Anomaly detection is a technique used for identifying rare items, events or observations, which deviate significantly from the majority of the data and do not conform to a well defined notion of normal behavior wikipedia.&#xA;Anomaly detection has very wide applications, such as Fraud detection in credit card transactions ref, Network Intrusion detection ref, and Cancer cell detection ref.&#xA;A wide spectrum of techniques have been proposed for anomaly detection, some of the popular methods are: Density-based techniques (e.</description>

      <description>1. Project Overview In this project, we will build a model for image classification and understand how it works.&#xA;In the first part, we will develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for food image classification. We will also apply t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique on the output of different layers to visualize learned visual representations of the CNN model.&#xA;In order to understand how the model works, we will employ four popular Explainable AI approaches in the second part, including (1) Saliency map, (2) Smooth gradient, (3) Lime package, and (4) Integrated gradients.</description>

      <description>1. Overview In this project, we will focus on New York City&amp;rsquo;s Ridesharing Trips Data Set and try to answer three interesting questions:&#xA;(1) How do the residents of New York City use Ridesharing?&#xA;(2) What usage patterns can we see?&#xA;(3) Can we predict usage?&#xA;To answer these questions, first we will clean up the trip data and integrate them with weather data and taxi zone geodata. Then we will conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Statistical Tests to find Temporal and Spatial Patterns, as well as weather effects and tipping behaviors.</description>
