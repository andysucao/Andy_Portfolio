      <title>Project 5: Using Autoencoder for Anomaly Detection and searching similar images</title>
      <link>https://andysucao.github.io/Andy_Portfolio/post/project-5/</link>

      <description>1. Overview Anomaly detection is a technique used for identifying rare items, events or observations, which deviate significantly from the majority of the data and do not conform to a well defined notion of normal behavior wikipedia.
Anomaly detection has very wide applications, such as Fraud detection in credit card transactions ref, Network Intrusion detection ref, and Cancer cell detection ref.
A wide spectrum of techniques have been proposed for anomaly detection, some of the popular methods are: Density-based techniques (e.</description>

      <title>Project 4: Image Classification and Explainable Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://andysucao.github.io/Andy_Portfolio/post/project-4/</link>

      <description>1. Project Overview In this project, we will build a model for image classification and understand how it works.
In the first part, we will develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for food image classification. We will also apply t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique on the output of different layers to visualize learned visual representations of the CNN model.
In order to understand how the model works, we will employ four popular Explainable AI approaches in the second part, including (1) Saliency map, (2) Smooth gradient, (3) Lime package, and (4) Integrated gradients.</description>

      <title>Project 3: Understanding Ridesharing Demands in New York City</title>
      <link>https://andysucao.github.io/Andy_Portfolio/post/project-3/</link>

      <description>1. Overview In this project, we will focus on New York City&amp;rsquo;s Ridesharing Trips Data Set and try to answer three interesting questions:
(1) How do the residents of New York City use Ridesharing?
(2) What usage patterns can we see?
(3) Can we predict usage?
To answer these questions, first we will clean up the trip data and integrate them with weather data and taxi zone geodata. Then we will conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Statistical Tests to find Temporal and Spatial Patterns, as well as weather effects and tipping behaviors.</description>

      <title>Project 2: Predicitng Customer Churn for a Mobile Phone Carrier</title>
      <link>https://andysucao.github.io/Andy_Portfolio/post/project-2/</link>

      <guid>https://andysucao.github.io/Andy_Portfolio/post/project-2/</guid>
      <description>1. Overview In this project, we will build a series of models to predict the probability of Customer Churn for a Mobile Phone Carrier.
In the first part, we will conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Here the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) method is employed to address the imbalanced classification problem. Then we will develop customer churn prediction models based on (1) Logistic Regression, (2) Decision Tree, (3) Random Forest, (4) AdaBoost, (5) Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), and (6) Neural Network.</description>

      <title>Project 1: Predict Real Estate Prices in Beijing</title>
      <link>https://andysucao.github.io/Andy_Portfolio/post/project-1/</link>

      <description>1. Overview In this project, we will build a linear regression model to help people better understand the factors that can affect the price of a house in Beijing.
The main sections of this article are: (1) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), (2) Developing Linear Regression model for predicting real estate price, and (3) Use that model to make predictions.
The Python Notebook containing the complete model development process and the data used in this project can be found at Google Drive.</description>
